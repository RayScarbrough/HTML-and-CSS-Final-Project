		</header>
	<article id="primary">
		<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 6, Primary reinforcer</h3><p> Primary reinforcers are reinforcers
		that have innate reinforcing qualities. These kinds of <img src="media/younghermit.jpg" alt="YoungHermit">
		reinforcers are not learned. Water, food, sleep, shelter,
		sex, and touch, among others, are primary reinforcers. 
	   
	   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">“He is deeply, almost dangerously hungry.
	   Back at his tent, his edible supplies are a couple of crackers, some ground coffee,
	   and a few packets of artificial sweetener. That’s it. If he’d waited much longer,
	   he would have risked becoming tent-bound from weakness. He shines his light on boxes
	   of hamburger patties and blocks of cheese, bags of sausage and packs of bacon. 
	   His heart leaps and his stomach calls and he sets upon the food, loading it into his backpack;
	   smorgasbord”(Finkel, p.14).
	   </p>
	   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">Christopher Knight's need for food served as a primary
	   reinforcer in his decision to commit over one thousand break-ins during his nearly three decades in
		the wilderness (Finkel p. 14). In the pursuit of satisfying his
	   fundamental need for food, the act of breaking into cabins became directly linked to the
	   rewarding outcome of obtaining food and satiating his hunger. This association established
	   a powerful reinforcement for Knight, as the basic necessity of nourishment drove him to 
	   repeat the behavior for twenty seven years. The primal instinct to secure sustenance can
	   strongly influence behavior, and in Knight's case, the need for food acted as a primary 
	   reinforcer, shaping his actions in the isolated wilderness where survival presented itself
	   as a constant challenge.

   <article id="Sleep">

   <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4, Sleep Debt</h3><p> Sleep debt, also known as sleep deficit,
	   is the difference between how much sleep one needs and how much they<img src="media/NorthPondWinter.jpg" alt="NorthPond"> 
	    actually get. If one regularly loses
	   sleep or chooses to sleep less than needed, the sleep loss adds up, and the total sleep lost is called their
	   sleep debt.
	   <br>
	   <br>
	   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">Sleep debt, stemming from chronic insufficient sleep, is a common 
	   theme in Knight's story, with explicit references to his sleeping habits during harsh Maine winters and his
	   troubled rest while incarcerated.  Twenty-six brutal winters, Knight implemented a nightly routine to endure
	   the cold, sleeping only six and a half hours and waking at two a.m. to combat the frigid temperatures.
	   Knight's deliberate avoidance of daytime naps underscores his commitment to achieving as deep and replenishing
	   sleep as he could during the night. "No matter how tempted he was to crawl back into his covers, he resisted.
	   Naps were not permitted in his ideology, as they ruined his ability to achieve deep, rejuvenating sleep"
	   (Finkel, p 98).
	   This pattern of consistently obtaining around six hours of sleep each night during extended winter periods undoubtedly 
	   resulted in substantial sleep debt. Moreover, Knight's seven-month incarceration revealed another facet of his struggle
	   with sleep. The unfamiliar and anxiety inducing jail environment disrupted his sleep, leading to constant tiredness
	   and anxiety. Knight candidly admitted, "You asked how I sleep. Little and uneasy. I am nearly always tired and nervous"
	   (Finkel, p. 41). These experiences underscore the pervasive impact of sleep debt on Knight's well-being, manifested in 
	   his perpetual fatigue and heightened state of anxiety.

   <article id="Sympathetic">

	   <h3 id="Sympathetic" style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 3, Sympathetic Nervous System</h3><p> The sympathetic nervous system is
		   a subdivision of the autonomic nervous system that triggers the fight-or-flight response,<img src="media/BreakIn_1.jpeg" alt="BreakIn">
			providing the body with
		   a burst of energy to respond to perceived dangers.” 
		   <br>
	   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">“During a burglary, there wasn’t a moment’s ease. “My adrenaline
		   was spiking, my heart rate was soaring. My blood pressure was high. I was always scared when stealing.
		   Always. I wanted it over as quickly as possible.” The only time he paused for more than a moment during
		   a raid was when the weather was cold and he needed to thaw something out. If meat was frozen,
		   he’d pop it in the microwave” (Finkel, p. 81).</p> 
	   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">During his break-ins to nearby cabins and camps, Knight's sympathetic
		   nervous system played an important role in initiating the fight-or-flight response. As he entered properties to
		   steal supplies, his senses heightened, and his body prepared for action. The sympathetic nervous system, often
		   referred to as the body's "gas pedal," kicked in, releasing adrenaline into his bloodstream. This surge of
		   adrenaline increased Knight's heart rate, dilated his airways, and provided a burst of energy, enabling him 
		   to swiftly navigate the unfamiliar terrain and make quick decisions to help avoid detection (Finkel p. 81)

   <article id="Displaced">

	   <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 6 lecture, Displaced Aggression</h3><p> "Displaced aggression is the direction of hostility away
		   from the source of frustration or anger and toward either the self or a different entity.” <br>
		   <br>
		   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">“I’m not sorry about being rude if it gets to the point quicker,” he said.
		   Here’s what he had written in a letter about an author photo of mine he’d
		   <img src="media/cleanshave.jpg" alt="cleanShave">
		   seen in the sample packet of writing I’d mailed him: “You look particularly nerdy.
		   Next time, have your wife pick the picture.” When I mentioned during the visit that
		   my son’s name is Beckett, he said, “Ugh. Terrible. Why did you name him that? He’s 
		   going to hate you when he gets older.” (Finkel p. 48).</p>
		   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">Aggression displacement involves directing frustration,
			anger and aggression at a less
		   threatening target than the original triggering person or experience. Knight, not being
		   one to  have a physical altercation with someone, uses rude remarks to lash out against
		   Finkel. This is a prime example of displaced anger. Knight cannot lash out against the
		   guards, police nor judge that have incarcerated him. Doing so would result in more
		   repercussions for Knight.  Instead he chooses to direct  his anger towards Finkel 
		   who is hundreds of miles away. Aiming his frustration towards Finkel has no direct
		   consequences and very little risk of retaliation other than a strongly worded letter
		   or not receiving a reply. Both of which would likely not bother Knight as he is used
		   to isolation and no communication at all.</p>

   <article id="Meditation">

	   <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4, Meditation</h3><p> Meditation is a practice of 
		   clearing the mind in order to achieve a state of relaxed awareness and focus.
		   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">Knight's engagement with meditation emerges as a psychological
			   <img src="media/inDaClub.jpg" alt="hermitInTent">
			   strategy, offering him a coping mechanism within his jail cell. "I found relief and release in the act 
			   of imagining the woods just beyond the cinder-block walls… He could almost hear the “song of salt and 
			   fat frying” as he cooked on his camp stove. Mostly, he just wished for quiet—“all the quiet I can take,
			   consume, eat, dine upon, savor, relish, feast.” "(Finkel, p. 41) expressing a deep desire for the 
			   serenity of nature . This vivid visualization, complete with details of flourishing wildflowers and
			   the sizzling sounds of cooking, signifies his effort to immerse himself in a meditative escape (Finkel, p. 41).
			   A manifestation of mindfulness meditation. Here, the psychological impact is palpable as Knight employs
			   this technique to concentrate on sensory details, momentarily transporting himself from the harsh
			   reality of incarceration.
		   </p>
		   <p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">Knight's meditation practice follows a pattern
			   but is not consistent, surfacing in moments of imminent danger. He states, "I didn’t 
			   meditate every day, month, season in the woods. Just when death was near. Death in the
			   form of too little food or too much cold for too long” (Finkel, p. 42). This unveils 
			   a distinctive psychological function of meditation for Knight. It becomes a tool for
			   confronting mortality and extreme challenges. By engaging in mindfulness meditation 
			   during life-threatening situations, Knight utilizes the practice to ground himself in
			   the present moment, finding mental solace and resilience. These instances underscore
			   the psychological impact of meditation on Knight's well being, enabling him to cope 
			   with his harsh conditions.</p>

   <article id="bias">

	<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 7, Representative Bias</h3><p> A faulty way of thinking,
		 in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something.  

		<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">“The man is wearing new-looking blue jeans, a hooded gray
			sweatshirt beneath a nice Columbia jacket, and sturdy work boots. It’s like he has just gone shopping
			at the mall. His backpack is from L. L. Bean. Only his eyeglasses, with chunky plastic frames, 
			seem outdated. There’s no dirt on him anywhere, and little more than a shading of stubble on his chin.
			He has no noticeable body odor. His thinning hair, mostly covered by his wool cap, is neatly cropped.
			His skin is strangely pale, with several scabs on his wrists. He’s a little over six feet tall and 
			broad-shouldered, maybe one hundred and eighty pounds” (Finkel, p.20)
	
			<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">“At one cabin, where the camera was hidden in a smoke detector, there was success: the hermit was captured on film,
			peering into a refrigerator. The images were confusing. The thief’s face wasn’t in focus, but they appeared to 
			show a clean, well-dressed man who was neither emaciated nor bearded—highly unlikely to have been 
			roughing it in the woods. He didn’t appear
			nimble, or strong, or even outdoorsy. “Mr. Ordinary,” one person called him. It was probable, people deduced,
			that this so-called hermit had been a neighbor all along” (Finkel, p. 32).
			
			<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">Representative bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals assess the likelihood of an event
			based on how well it conforms to a stereotype. This can lead people to make judgments and predictions
			based on superficial similarities, often overlooking rational probabilities or the larger context.
			For instance, if a person's stereotype of a teacher is an older woman with glasses, they might assume 
			that a person fitting this description is more likely to be a teacher than a younger person without glasses.
			 Representative bias can result in faulty reasoning, as it fails to consider the diversity and complexity of
			  real-world situations.
			
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-left: 0;">Knight's case is full of instances of representative bias, where observers
			unintentionally stereotype him based on their stereotyped notions of a hermit. The description of Knight's appearance,
			new-looking blue jeans, a hooded gray sweatshirt, and a Columbia jacket, challenges the typical image that
			comes to mind with a hermit living in the woods (Finkel, p.20). Despite the evidence, the assumption of a clean,
			well-dressed man, neither emaciated nor bearded,caused doubt if Knight was truly a hermit.
			The images from the hidden camera, showing Knight looking into a refrigerator, added to the confusion,
			leading people to dub him "Mr. Ordinary" and assuming he was a neighbor all along (Finkel, p.32).
			The notion that a hermit conforms to certain physical characteristics or behaviors is a representative bias,
			hindering a more accurate understanding of Knight's complex situation. This bias contributed
			to misconceptions about his identity and of his unconventional lifestyle.</p>
